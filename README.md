# Fire-Emblem


This game was inspired by the 2003 Game Boy RPG <em> Fire Emblem - The Blazing Blade </em> and adapted to a context in
which the player has to get through Computer Science subjects, util reaching the final boss, 
our Computer Architecture professor (Mr. Lamar is totally fine about that). 



## Intalation and Running
To play this game, one should clone this repository and use a RISC-V simulator to run 'main.s' archive. Some options like the <a href="https://github.com/LeoRiether/FPGRARS">FPGRARS</a> are viable, but
we strongly recommend the RARS app that will be dowloaded with the code. If that’s the case, don’t forget to click on ‘tools’ and connect both the Keyboard MMIO and the Bitmap Display to the program.


## Usage


 All actions in the game are made using 'W', 'A', 'S' and 'D' keys to select and the space bar to confirm. Every turn, the player can pick an ally and
 change its position within a certain range. After that, the user might pick between changing a character\`s weapon, passing the turn, or attacking an enemy, if there\`s one right next to the selected character. 
 The interactions during fights take in consideration a "rock, paper, scisor" system, in which the computer defeats a calculator, which defeats a pencil, which defeats a computer.
